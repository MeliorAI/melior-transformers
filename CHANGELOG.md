- Added `.drone.yml` placeholder

## [0.15.4+melior1.0.0] - 2019-01-13
### Fixed
- `sliding_window` removed in order to have direct compatibility with Transformers models.
- `metric_criteria` and `save_n_best_epochs` parameters added. These allow to save the best model.

## [0.15.4] - 2019-12-31
### Fixed
- Fixed bug in `QuestonAnsweringModel` when using `evaluate_during_training`.

## [0.15.3] - 2019-12-31
### Fixed
- Fixed bug in MultiLabelClassificationModel due to `tensorboard_dir` being missing in parameter dictionary.

### Changed
- Renamed `tensorboard_folder` to `tensorboard_dir` for consistency.

## [0.15.2] - 2019-12-28
### Added
- Added `tensorboard_folder` to parameter dictionary which can be used to specify the directory in which the tensorboard files will be stored.

## [0.15.1] - 2019-12-27
### Added
- Added `**kwargs` to support different accuracy measures at training time.

## [0.15.0] - 2019-12-24
### Added
- Added `evaluate_during_training_steps` parameter that specifies when evaluation should be performed during training.

### Changed
- A model checkpoint will be created for each evaluation during training and the evaluation results will be saved along with the model.

## [0.14.0] - 2019-12-24
### Added
- Added option to specify a GPU to be used when multiple GPUs are available. E.g.: `cuda_device=1`
- Added `do_lower_case` argument for uncased models.

### Fixed
- Fixed possible bug with output directory not being created before evaluation is run when using `evaluate_during_training`.

## [0.13.4] - 2019-12-21
### Fixed
- Fixed bug with when using `eval_during_training` with QuestionAnswering model.

## [0.13.3] - 2019-12-21

## [0.11.0] - 2019-12-15
### Added
- CamemBERT can now be used with NERModel.

### Changed
- Readme changed to include CamemBERT for NER.

## [0.10.8] - 2019-12-15
